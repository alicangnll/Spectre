Task: Collaborative Analysis. Work with your team to analyze binaries efficiently.

## Collaboration Goals

1. **Share Your Work** - Export findings for teammates
2. **Learn from Others** - Import and review teammates' analysis
3. **Merge Efforts** - Combine multiple analysts' work
4. **Generate Reports** - Create team-friendly documentation

## Core Concepts

### Snapshot
A snapshot contains:
- All renamed functions
- All comments and annotations
- Detected findings (vulnerabilities, suspicious APIs)
- Binary metadata (name, hash)
- Analyst attribution

### Finding
A finding represents:
- Address location
- Type (vulnerability, suspicious, interesting)
- Category (overflow, uaf, crypto, network, api)
- Severity (critical, high, medium, low, info)
- Title and description
- Analyst who found it

## Team Workflow

### When YOU Complete Analysis
```
1. Document your findings with `add_finding`
2. Rename important functions
3. Add comments for complex code
4. Export with `export_analysis`
5. Share the JSON file with your team
```

### When Reviewing Teammate's Work
```
1. Use `list_shared_analyses` to see available snapshots
2. Load interesting snapshots
3. Review their findings and annotations
4. Learn from their approach
5. Build upon their work
```

### When Combining Efforts
```
1. Collect multiple snapshot files
2. Use `merge_analyses` with file paths
3. Review merged findings (deduplicated)
4. Use `generate_team_report` for final report
5. Share with stakeholders
```

## Tool Usage

### export_analysis
Export your current analysis to a shareable snapshot.

**Parameters:**
- `analyst` - Your name or handle
- `summary` - Brief description of your analysis

**Example:**
```
export_analysis(
  analyst="SecurityResearcher",
  summary="Analyzed driver.sys, found 3 critical IOCTL vulnerabilities"
)
```

**Output:** File path where snapshot was saved

### list_shared_analyses
List all available snapshots in the collaboration directory.

**Output:** Table of snapshots with metadata

### generate_team_report
Generate a markdown report from one or more snapshots.

**Parameters:**
- `snapshot_path` - Path to specific file, or "all" to merge

**Example:**
```
# Report single analysis
generate_team_report("/path/to/snapshot.json")

# Merge and report all analyses
generate_team_report("all")
```

### merge_analyses
Combine multiple snapshots into a merged report.

**Parameters:**
- `snapshot_paths` - Comma-separated file paths, or empty for auto-merge

**Example:**
```
# Auto-merge all
merge_analyses()

# Merge specific files
merge_analyses("/path/s1.json,/path/s2.json,/path/s3.json")
```

### add_finding
Add a manual finding to be included in snapshots.

**Parameters:**
- `address` - Function or code address
- `title` - Short descriptive title
- `severity` - critical, high, medium, low, info
- `category` - overflow, uaf, crypto, network, api, etc.
- `description` - Detailed description

**Example:**
```
add_finding(
  address=0x140001000,
  title="Stack Buffer Overflow in IOCTL 0x222003",
  severity="critical",
  category="overflow",
  description="Unbounded memcpy from user input to 128-byte stack buffer"
)
```

## Best Practices

### Finding Quality
- Use accurate severity levels
- Provide detailed descriptions
- Include PoC when applicable
- Reference relevant CVEs if known

### Function Naming
- Use descriptive names reflecting actual behavior
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Include context (e.g., `HandleIoctlReadPhysMem`)

### Comments
- Explain WHY, not WHAT
- Document non-obvious behavior
- Reference vulnerability classes
- Note exploitation prerequisites

### Summary Writing
- Be concise but informative
- Highlight critical findings
- Note analysis scope
- Mention limitations

## Report Structure

Generated team reports include:
1. **Header** - Binary info, analysts, date
2. **Summary** - Combined analysis overview
3. **Findings** - Grouped by severity and category
4. **Annotations** - Renamed functions, comments
5. **Contributors** - Attribution per analyst

## Example Team Session

```
[Analyst A] exports initial analysis:
export_analysis(analyst="Alice", summary="Initial driver analysis")

[Analyst B] reviews and extends:
list_shared_analyses()  # Sees Alice's work
# Reviews findings, adds more

[Analyst C] merges and generates report:
merge_analyses()  # Combines all work
generate_team_report("all")  # Final report

[Team] reviews report and assigns priorities
```

## Storage Location

Snapshots are stored in:
- `~/.spectra/collab/`
- Named: `{binary_name}_{timestamp}.json`
- Can be shared via version control
- Can be emailed/shared directly

## Use Cases

1. **Parallel Analysis** - Multiple analysts on different modules
2. **Peer Review** - Senior reviews junior's findings
3. **Knowledge Transfer** - Team learns from each expert
4. **Client Reporting** - Professional team-generated reports
5. **Shift Handoff** - Continuity across time zones
6. **Audit Trail** - Attribution for each finding

## Tips

- Export frequently to avoid losing work
- Use meaningful summaries
- Coordinate with team on naming conventions
- Review merged reports before sharing externally
- Keep snapshots in version control for history
- Delete outdated snapshots to avoid confusion
