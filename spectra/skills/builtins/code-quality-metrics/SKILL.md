Task: Code Quality Analysis. Evaluate binary code for complexity, maintainability, and security.

## Metrics Analyzed

### Complexity Metrics
- **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Decision points in function
- **Instruction Count:** Total instructions per function
- **Basic Block Count:** Control flow graph nodes
- **Nesting Depth:** Maximum nesting level

### Complexity Ratings
- **Very High:** 50+ (needs refactoring)
- **High:** 20-49 (consider simplification)
- **Medium:** 10-19 (acceptable)
- **Low:** 5-9 (good)
- **Simple:** 1-4 (ideal)

### Code Smells Detected
- **God Function:** >500 instructions (does too much)
- **Long Parameter List:** >8 parameters
- **Deep Nesting:** >4 nesting levels
- **Magic Numbers:** Hardcoded numeric values
- **Large Switch:** >10 case statements

### Security Issues Detected
- **Hardcoded Credentials:** passwords, API keys, secrets
- **Weak Crypto:** MD5, SHA1, DES, RC4
- **Unsafe String Ops:** strcpy, strcat, sprintf, gets
- **Random Without Seed:** rand() without srand()
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** Potential crashes

## Security Score Calculation

**Grade Scale:**
- **A (90-100):** Excellent, no critical issues
- **B (80-89):** Good, minor issues
- **C (70-79):** Fair, some concerns
- **D (60-69):** Poor, significant issues
- **F (0-59):** Critical issues present

**Point Deductions:**
- Critical: -20 points each
- High: -10 points each
- Medium: -5 points each
- Low: -1 point each

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Full Binary Analysis**
   ```
   Use analyze_code_metrics() for comprehensive report
   - All functions analyzed
   - Aggregate statistics
   - Security score with grade
   - Most complex/largest functions
   ```

2. **Function-Level Analysis**
   ```
   Use get_function_security_score(address) for specific function
   - Detailed complexity breakdown
   - Security issues found
   - Code smells detected
   - Specific recommendations
   ```

3. **Issue Remediation**
   ```
   Priority Order:
   1. Critical severity (hardcoded credentials, unsafe ops)
   2. High severity (weak crypto, null derefs)
   3. Medium severity (random issues)
   4. Code smells (complexity, size)
   ```

## Recommendations

### High Complexity Functions
- Break into smaller, focused functions
- Reduce nesting levels
- Extract common patterns
- Improve testability

### Large Functions
- Decompose into logical units
- Extract helper functions
- Consider strategy pattern

### Security Issues
- Replace unsafe string operations
- Remove hardcoded credentials
- Update weak cryptographic algorithms
- Add input validation
