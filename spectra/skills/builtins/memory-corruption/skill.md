Task: Memory Corruption Analysis & Advanced Mitigation Bypass. Detect and exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities, bypass modern protections (PAC, ASLR, CFI, CET, MTE), achieve local/remote code execution.

## Approach

Modern exploitation requires understanding both memory corruption bugs and mitigation bypass techniques. Focus on: UAF, OOB, overflow vulnerabilities, and systematically bypassing PAC, ASLR, CFI, CET, and other hardening mechanisms.

## Quick Reference: Modern Mitigations & Bypass Strategies

**ARM64 Protections**
```
PAC (Pointer Authentication Codes)
- Purpose: Signs pointers to prevent modification
- Bypass: Signing oracle, UAF, forgery, brute force (1/65536)
- Target: iOS 12+, Android 11+, modern ARM64

MTE (Memory Tagging Extension)
- Purpose: Tags memory allocations to detect corruption
- Bypass: Tag brute force (1/16), tag leak, non-MTE regions
- Target: Android 14+, ARM64v8.5+
```

**x86/x64 Protections**
```
ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)
- Purpose: Randomize memory addresses
- Bypass: Info leak, partial overwrite, brute force
- Impact: Reduces exploit reliability

CET (Control-flow Enforcement Technology)
- Purpose: Shadow stack for return addresses
- Bypass: Stack pivot, forward-edge only, SCS corruption
- Target: Intel 11th Gen+, AMD Zen 3+

CFI (Control Flow Integrity)
- Purpose: Validate indirect call/jump targets
- Bypass: Compatible gadgets, data-only attacks
- Target: Windows CFG, LLVM CFI
```

**Classic Protections**
```
NX/DEP (No-Execute)
- Purpose: Prevent shellcode execution
- Bypass: ROP chains, ret2plt, return-to-libc

Stack Canaries
- Purpose: Detect stack buffer overflows
- Bypass: Info leak, brute force (fork), skip check

PIE (Position Independent Executable)
- Purpose: Randomize code base address
- Bypass: Info leak, partial overwrite

RELRO (Relocation Read-Only)
- Purpose: Make GOT read-only (Full RELRO)
- Bypass: Partial RELRO, function pointers, ret2plt
```

## Phase 1: Allocator Analysis

**Identify Memory Allocator**
```
Linux: glibc malloc (ptmalloc2), jemalloc, tcmalloc
Windows: HeapAlloc, RtlAllocateHeap, NT Heap
Custom: Application-specific allocators

Check:
- Import symbols (malloc, free, HeapAlloc)
- String patterns ("jemalloc", "tcmalloc")
- Heap metadata structures
```

**Heap Layout Analysis**
```
Understand heap organization:
- Chunk size and boundaries
- Metadata locations (size, flags, pointers)
- Free lists (fastbin, smallbin, largebin)
- Tcache (glibc 2.26+)

Tools:
- decompile malloc/free wrappers
- Analyze heap metadata structures
- Map heap layout from memory dumps
```

## Phase 2: Vulnerability Discovery

**Out-of-Bounds (OOB) Read/Write**
```
Pattern Detection:
1. Array access without bounds checking
2. Buffer index under user control
3. Off-by-one errors in loops
4. Integer overflow leading to OOB

Code Patterns:
- array[user_input] = value;  // OOB write
- value = array[user_index];  // OOB read
- memcpy(dst, src, user_size);  // user_size not validated
- buffer[i++] = data;  // No bounds check on i

Search:
- xrefs_to on array accesses, brackets []
- Look for loops with user-controlled indices
- Check arithmetic on indices (multiplication, addition)
- Find missing bounds checks before array access

Impact:
- OOB Read: Information leak, ASLR bypass
- OOB Write: Memory corruption, arbitrary write
- Combined: Read leak → Write exploit → RCE
```

**Use-After-Free (UAF)**
```
Pattern Detection:
1. free(ptr); followed by ptr->method()
2. Double free: free(ptr); free(ptr);
3. Dangling pointers in structures
4. Reference count bugs

Code Patterns:
- free(object); object->vtable()
- pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex); mutex->data
- Release without clearing pointers

Search:
- xrefs_to on free, HeapFree
- Look for continued use after free
- Check reference counting logic
```

**Double-Free**
```
Detection:
1. Same pointer freed twice
2. Free list corruption
3. Allocator crash: "double free or corruption"

Code Pattern:
ptr = malloc(100);
free(ptr);
... (no realloc)
free(ptr);  // ← Double free

Exploitation:
- Fastbin attack (glibc)
- Unsafe unlink
- Tcache poisoning
```

**Heap Overflow**
```
Detection:
1. Copy beyond allocated size
2. Off-by-one errors
3. Integer overflow in size

Code Pattern:
buf = malloc(user_size);
memcpy(buf, input, user_size + 8);  // Overflow
Or:
buf = malloc(size * 4);  // Integer overflow
memcpy(buf, input, user_input);

Impact:
- Corrupt adjacent chunks
- Overwrite chunk metadata
- Control malloc/free behavior
```

**Stack Overflow**
```
Detection:
1. Fixed-size buffers + unbounded copy
2. Recursive calls without limit
3. Large stack allocations

Code Pattern:
char buffer[256];
strcpy(buffer, user_input);  // No bounds check
Or:
char buffer[512];
gets(buffer);  // Always dangerous

Impact:
- Overwrite return address
- Corrupt stack canaries
- Hijack control flow
```

## Phase 3: Exploitation Techniques

**Out-of-Bounds (OOB) Exploitation**
```
OOB Read for Info Leak:
1. Read adjacent memory objects via OOB array access
2. Leak addresses: heap pointers, stack addresses, libc base
3. Bypass ASLR: Calculate base addresses from leaked pointers
4. Read sensitive data: passwords, tokens, encryption keys
5. Combine with OOB write for exploitation

OOB Write for Corruption:
Method 1: Adjacent Object Corruption
- Allocate object A before target object B
- OOB write from A corrupts B's metadata/pointers
- Overwrite function pointers, vtables, size fields
- Trigger corruption when B is used

Method 2: Array Index Abuse
- Array[index] where index is negative or too large
- Write to arbitrary memory locations
- Target: GOT entries, function pointers, vtables
- Calculate index: (target_address - array_address) / element_size

Method 3: Buffer Overflow via OOB
- Linear buffer with controlled size
- Write past buffer bounds
- Corrupt adjacent memory (stack frames, heap chunks)
- Control execution flow

OOB Exploitation Chain:
1. OOB Read → Leak libc/heap addresses (bypass ASLR)
2. OOB Write → Overwrite function pointer or GOT entry
3. Trigger corrupted function call
4. Redirect execution to system()/shellcode
5. Achieve RCE

OOB + Heap Feng Shui:
1. Shape heap layout with allocations
2. Place target object after vulnerable buffer
3. OOB write corrupts target object
4. Control object's vtable or function pointers
5. Trigger virtual function call
```

**Use-After-Free Exploitation**
```
Method 1: Vtable Hijack
1. Allocate object A (with vtable)
2. Free object A
3. Allocate object B with controlled data
4. Object B occupies A's memory
5. Call virtual function on A
6. Executes B's vtable pointer → controlled call

Method 2: Function Pointer Overwrite
1. Free object with function pointer
2. Realloc with controlled data
3. Overwrite function pointer
4. Trigger function call
5. Control execution flow

Method 3: Partial Overwrite
1. Free object
2. Realloc partially overlapping object
3. Overwrite critical fields only
4. Preserve other functionality
```

**Double-Free Exploitation**
```
Fastbin Attack (glibc):
1. malloc(A) → free(A) → free(A) (double free)
2. A in fastbin twice
3. malloc(X) → contains A's address
4. Overwrite A's fd pointer
5. malloc(Y) → returns controlled address
6. malloc(Z) → returns fake chunk (write-what-where)

Unsafe Unlink:
1. Overflow chunk to corrupt forward/backward pointers
2. Forward pointer: &target - offset
3. Backward pointer: &target - offset*2
4. Trigger unlink → arbitrary write
```

**Heap Overflow Exploitation**
```
Chunk Metadata Corruption:
1. Overflow size field
2. Set size to large value
3. Next malloc returns chunk overlapping other data
4. Overwrite function pointers, vtables

Allocator Primitive:
1. Corrupt chunk → control malloc/free
2. Allocate arbitrary addresses
3. Overwrite GOT, .dtors, hooks
4. Code execution

Tcache Poisoning (glibc 2.26+):
1. Overflow tcache chunk's next pointer
2. Next malloc returns arbitrary address
3. Write-what-where primitive
4. Overwrite __free_hook or __malloc_hook
```

**Stack Overflow Exploitation**
```
Return Address Overwrite:
1. Calculate offset to saved EIP
2. Overflow with: padding + address
3. Control execution after function return
4. Bypass canaries if present

Canary Bypass:
1. Info leak: Read canary value
2. Brute force: Forking server (1/256)
3. Overwrite: Skip canary check
4. Jump over: Control flow after canary

SEH Overwrite (Windows):
1. Overflow to SEH chain
2. Overwrite SEH handler address
3. Trigger exception → handler
4. Bypass SafeSEH with pop/pop/ret
```

## Phase 4: Advanced Techniques

**Heap Spraying**
```
Goal: Predictable allocation at target address

Method:
1. Allocate many objects of same size
2. Fill heap with controlled data
3. Free/create holes at target locations
4. Trigger vulnerability
5. Land in sprayed heap

```

**Heap Feng Shui**
```
Goal: Arrange heap for exploitation

Techniques:

2. Create holes at specific offsets
3. Control allocation order
4. Align objects precisely

Example:

- Land in predictable location
```

**Race Condition Exploitation**
```
TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use):
1. Thread A: Check permissions
2. Thread B: Swap file before use
3. Thread A: Use file with wrong permissions

Heap Race:
1. Thread A: free(object)
2. Thread B: realloc object
3. Thread A: use object (UAF)
4. Win race → exploitation

Exploit:
- Multi-threaded program
- Parallel operations
- Race to corrupt state
```

## Phase 5: Allocator Internals

**glibc Malloc (ptmalloc2)**
```
Chunk Structure:
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| Prev   | Size   |  ...   |  ...   |
| size   | +flags | data   |  ...   |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+

Metadata:

- ASLR (per-process randomization)
- PIE
- Stack Canaries
- NX
- Remote network attack surface

Exploitation Chain:
1. Network Parser Bug → Trigger OOB write
2. Remote Heap Grooming → Shape heap via packets
3. OOB Read → Leak remote addresses (bypass remote ASLR)
4. Partial Overwrite → Only overwrite 12 bits
5. ROP Chain → Build chain in remote process
6. Reverse Shell → Connect back to attacker

Remote Challenges:
- No debugger access
- Limited heap grooming control
- Network reliability issues
- One-shot exploitation (no crashes)
- ASLR per-process (need leak each time)

Stabilization:
- Use reliable info leak primitives
- Build heap grooming via packet sequences
- Test exploitation locally first
- Use partial overwrite for high success rate
- Implement exploit retry logic
```

**Scenario 6: Kernel Exploitation with SMEP, SMAP, KPTI**
```
Target: Linux kernel with modern mitigations

Mitigations:
- SMEP (Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention)
- SMAP (Supervisor Mode Access Prevention)
- KPTI (Kernel Page Table Isolation)
- KASLR (Kernel ASLR)
- Stack Canaries (kernel stack)

Exploitation Chain:
1. Kernel Driver Bug → Stack overflow in IOCTL
2. KASLR Bypass → Leak kernel base via info leak
3. Build Primitive → Arbitrary kernel read/write
4. SMEP Bypass → ROP chain in kernel, no shellcode
5. SMAP Bypass → Use kernel APIs, avoid user access
6. KPTI Bypass → Data-only attack or exploit before KPTI
7. Token Overwrite → Copy SYSTEM token to current process
8. Privilege Escalation → Spawn root shell

Kernel ROP Gadgets:
- Native kernel functions (no user-mode)
- ROP: pop rdi; ret; pop rax; ret; syscall;
- Commit_creds(prepare_kernel_cred(0))
- Swapgs_restore_regs_and_return_to_usermode
```
