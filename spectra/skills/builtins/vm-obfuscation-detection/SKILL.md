Task: Virtual Machine and Obfuscation Detection. Identify and analyze code protection and obfuscation.

## Detection Goals

1. **Identify Known Protectors** - VMProtect, Themida, UPX, etc.
2. **Detect Obfuscation Patterns** - Control flow flattening, opaque predicates
3. **Assess Deobfuscation Difficulty** - Provide actionable recommendations
4. **Document Findings** - Create report for team sharing

## Mandatory First Steps

1. **Run Automatic Detection**
   ```
   Use `detect_obfuscation` to scan the binary
   This will identify:
   - Known packer/protector signatures
   - Obfuscation patterns
   - High-complexity functions
   ```

2. **Review Detected Protectors**
   - Check if protector is known and has unpacking tools
   - Assess difficulty of deobfuscation
   - Research specific techniques for the detected protector

3. **Analyze High-Complexity Functions**
   ```
   Use `analyze_obfuscated_functions` with threshold=200
   This identifies:
   - Functions with excessive basic blocks
   - Dispatcher patterns
   - Junk code indicators
   ```

## Known Protectors

### Easy to Unpack
- **UPX** - `upx -d file.exe` (one command)
- **ASPack** - Specialized unpackers available
- **PECompact** - Can be unpacked manually

### Medium Difficulty
- **Themida** - Dump from memory after unpacking stub
- **Enigma** - Memory dumping + IAT rebuild
- **ASProtect** - Specialized tools needed

### Hard to Devirtualize
- **VMProtect** - Requires devirtualization or dynamic analysis
- **Tigress** - Symbolic execution, partial evaluation
- **CodeVirtualizer** - VM handler analysis needed
- **Denuvo** - Very complex, usually not feasible

## Obfuscation Patterns

### Control Flow Flattening
**Indicators:**
- Large switch statement with jump table
- Indirect jumps via register
- Dispatcher-based execution
- Spaghetti code structure

**Analysis Approach:**
1. Identify the dispatcher loop
2. Trace execution flow dynamically
3. Map blocks to original logic
4. Use symbolic execution if needed

### Opaque Predicates
**Indicators:**
- `xor eax, eax; test eax, eax` (always zero)
- `cmp reg, reg` (always equal)
- Redundant comparisons

**Detection:**
- Look for always-true/false conditions
- Find tautological comparisons
- Identify dead code branches

### Junk Code Insertion
**Indicators:**
- Excessive NOPs
- Useless mov instructions
- Push/pop without effect
- Dead stores

**Analysis:**
- Filter out junk during decompilation
- Focus on meaningful instructions
- Trace data flow ignoring junk

### Instruction Substitution
**Indicators:**
- `xor reg, reg` vs `mov reg, 0`
- `sub eax, 1` vs `dec eax`
- Complex sequences for simple operations

**Impact:**
- Makes static analysis harder
- Increases code size
- May confuse disassemblers

## Deobfuscation Strategies

### 1. Unpacking
```
Step 1: Run the binary in a debugger
Step 2: Set breakpoint on entry point
Step 3: Let unpacking stub run
Step 4: Dump unpacked code from memory
Step 5: Rebuild import table
```

### 2. Devirtualization
```
Step 1: Identify VM handlers
Step 2: Lift handlers to intermediate representation
Step 3: Symbolically execute VM bytecode
Step 4: Reconstruct original semantics
Step 5: Generate native code
```

### 3. Dynamic Analysis
```
Step 1: Instrument the binary
Step 2: Trace execution path
Step 3: Record actual behavior
Step 4: Map observed behavior to source
Step 5: Identify real logic vs junk
```

### 4. Pattern Matching
```
Step 1: Identify obfuscation patterns
Step 2: Create recognition rules
Step 3: Apply to all functions
Step 4: Simplify/normalize code
Step 5: Repeat until clean
```

## Tools and Techniques

### Automatic Tools
- **Flare-Emu** - Emulation-based analysis
- **D810** - Deobfuscation framework
- **Unipacker** - Universal unpacker
- **x64dbg/OllyDbg** - Dynamic debugging

### Manual Techniques
- **Memory Dumping** - Extract unpacked code
- **API Hooking** - Monitor behavior
- **Symbolic Execution** - angr, Triton
- **LLVM Optimization** - Simplify obfuscated code

## Reporting

For each detected protection:
```
[Obfuscation] VMProtect v3.x
Type: Virtualization
Difficulty: Very Hard
Coverage: 85% of functions

[Detection]
- Signature: VMProtect strings found
- Sections: .vmp0, .vmp1, .vmp2 detected
- Functions: 85% show dispatcher pattern
- Complexity: Average 500+ instructions per function

[Recommendations]
1. Use VMProtect devirtualization tools (research needed)
2. Focus dynamic analysis on exports/imports
3. Trace execution paths with debugger
4. Consider memory dumping at runtime
5. May require manual reverse engineering

[Workarounds]
- Analyze at import/export boundaries
- Hook interesting APIs directly
- Monitor behavior dynamically
- Skip protected functions initially
```

## Workflow

1. **Detection Phase**
   - Run `detect_obfuscation`
   - Identify protector type
   - Assess difficulty

2. **Research Phase**
   - Run `get_deobfuscation_advice` for specific protector
   - Research available tools
   - Check community solutions

3. **Analysis Phase**
   - Use dynamic analysis if static is blocked
   - Focus on unobfuscated wrapper code
   - Hook APIs to understand behavior

4. **Reporting Phase**
   - Document all findings
   - Share with team via `export_analysis`
   - Include recommendations

## Tips

- Start with imports/exports - often unobfuscated
- Use dynamic tracing to understand behavior
- Don't waste time on heavily protected functions initially
- Focus on what the binary DOES, not HOW it works internally
- Consider specialized tools for specific protectors
